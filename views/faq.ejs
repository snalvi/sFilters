        <h3>What is a Snapchat filter?</h3>

        <h3>How do you design the filter?</h3>
        <p>We take the utmost care to make the filter a perfect reflection of the couple and event. Once you order the filter, a designer will contact you to learn about your preferences - style, color, themes, venue, etc. We will then design a custom filter and send it to you for feedback.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="featured-text">
        <h3>What if I don't like the design?</h3>
        <p>We will revise our initial design based on your feedback. Two iterations of improvements are included in the cost of the filter.</p>
